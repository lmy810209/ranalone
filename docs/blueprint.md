## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A deep, digital black, '#0a0a0a', creating an immersive dark theme.
- Primary color: A desaturated, digital green, '#66CC89', used for main text and active elements, suggesting machine output.
- Accent color: A vibrant, eye-catching amber, '#F7BB1A', applied to critical UI elements, highlights, and alerts to evoke a warning or urgent digital signal.
- All text will use the 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) font, providing a uniform, monospace, and terminal-like aesthetic across the application.
- Minimalist, crisp line-art or pixel-style icons, rendered in the primary green or accent amber, to maintain a utilitarian, data-driven visual language.
- A spacious, grid-oriented layout emphasizing clear separation and readability, designed for observers. A prominent, static top banner displays the text: 'You are observing. Do not interfere.'
- Subtle, non-distracting animations, such as gentle fades for content transitions or occasional 'glitch' effects on interactive elements, to enhance the eerie and digital atmosphere.
